- **Persistent Goal Data**
  - Your goals and their completion status remain saved, so you never lose track of your progress.

- **Dynamic Progress Bar**
  - As goals are completed, the progress bar updates in real-time to visually show how close you are to achieving all your goals.

- **Motivational Quotes Based on Progress**
  - Dynamic motivational quotes are displayed based on how many goals you have completed, offering encouragement as you move forward.

- **Locked Goals Upon Completion**
